# Employee-Tracker
CLI Tracker application

## Description

For this project, I was tasked with creating a CMS employee tracker which uses the command line to populate a database. The project needed the functionality of being able to view all employees, view all roles, view all departments, add employees, add roles, add departments, and update employee roles. The page functioned in that when a user opens their terminal to install the npm packages and then starts the employee tracker, a series of questions will be asked through the command line, and based on the user's answers to those questions, information will either be displayed or stored in the database. My motivation to complete this project was to better understand MySql and the utilization of databases to store information. The project also deepened my understanding of how the command line can be utilized.

## Installation

To install the Employee Tracker, a user would need to download the files from the repository to their local system, run npm install to pull in the needed dependencies for the tracker, initialize the database info with the schema file and populate it with the seed file, and then run npm start to begin the prompts for the display and update of database information.
